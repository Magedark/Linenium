### Goals

LINE Webtoons does not have a notification system for creators when someone comments on a comic or replies to a comment. This program counts all the comments across all the comics in a LINE Webtoon comic. By being given a URL of the comic dashboard, it will count up all the comments and then compare it to the last known state of the comic, to see whether or not there are new comments.

### Technology
Uses behave for tests and Selenium for automation.
